We’re an 18-square-mile city, home to 125,000 residents, world class dining, international cultural attractions, award winning entertainment venues and some of the largest corporations in the nation. </p>

<p>Semantic tags make your page more human friendly.  It allows someone to view your code and see how the webpage is laid out</p>
<p>The order contesnt is displayed is main, article, section, nav, aside, header, footer</p>
<p>Snippets are very helpful.  I anticipate making more as I go forward with the course.  For something like a table, with a lot of components, it is so much easier than writing it all out</p>
<P>The most difficult part of this challenge for me was understanding that semantics are not seen on the site.  They are simply there to guide someone viewing the code, a human reader</P>
